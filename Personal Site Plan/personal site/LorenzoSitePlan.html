      <h3>Professional Growth</h3>
      <p>
        This page is intended to help you navigate and discover new resources to help those individuals who seek help primarily with their Finances, Net worth, and new ventures. This is about building a foundation by you, for you. Some people don’t know how to begin or if they even should be trying this kind of investment at all. My goal is to encourage and assist in this development. This might seem cumbersome at first without any previous experience, but this is about helping you develop those skills and network. From personal interpersonal skills to professional skills to help you grow. Once you develop a vision of where you want to be, what follows will simply be the steppingstones to a much better and improved network. 
Maybe you want travel, maybe you want to work from home, maybe you want to work less, or make a difference in your community. Regardless of what your goal is, might not achieve this without a mentor or advisor. When considering these goals, as large as they seem or simple…it doesn’t matter. When you try these recommendations, you will find more resources that this site might not have access to help you reach your goals, but this will simply mean that you are engaging with growth.

      <h3>Financial Education</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main focuses of this site is Financial Education.  Although its rather self-evident that most people have their finances managed from decent to pretty well, it was not without trial and error with some headaches, given that not all have an financial advisor or may seem that since one doesn’t have a lot of capital, that one doesn’t need it. This page is a guide to upgrade and “level up”. You want your money and assets to work for you. Be the “person” that has the financial skills, resources and knowledge when these skills are needed.  If you don’t think you need these resources, and that might  be the case, there is someone that you know that needs this help. Work to reduce dead weight waste, since many don’t consider having this, always verify and audit that you don’t have this problem. Learn to not have income be used unnecessarily. Think of your income as a business in which assets are not deadweight but steppingstones into financial freedom. Use all resources available at your disposal to their  maximum potential capacity, so when you need a break, there is no downtime for your resources. When managed well, your income works for you.

      <h3>Personal Wellness</h3>
      <p>
        This section is focused for anyone that wants to improve or have a plan for themselves for a latter time. One key aspect of Personal Wellness is being self-aware enough to desire to improve. Learn new skills that will make it simpler to enhance an individual's self-care regardless of what healthy shape this might seem to materialize into. An important component of Personal Wellness, is that since not many consider this to be a daily essential part of their lives, the individual will postpone addressing this helpful tool. A lot of burn out and fatigue without proper consistent revitalization led to stress, anxiety, and deterioration of one’s personal health leaving one vulnerable to other low impact events having severe consequences, when it could be more manageable. Mitigation of these factors can facilitate the improvement of several areas of their Personal Wellness Improvement Plan. When properly managed and handled, it becomes a steppingstone for a much simpler and comfortable daily life.
