        <p> One of the main focuses of this site is Financial Education.  Although its rather self-evident that most people have their finances managed from decent to pretty well, it was not without trial and error with some headaches, given that not all have an financial advisor or may seem that since one doesn’t have a lot of capital, that one doesn’t need it. This page is a guide to upgrade and “level up”. You want your money and assets to work for you. Be the “person” that has the financial skills, resources and knowledge when these skills are needed.</p>

        <p> If you don’t think you need these resources, and that might  be the case, there is someone that you know that needs this help. Work to reduce dead weight waste, since many don’t consider having this, always verify and audit that you don’t have this problem. Learn to not have income be used unnecessarily. Think of your income as a business in which assets are not deadweight but steppingstones into financial freedom. Use all resources available at your disposal to their  maximum potential capacity, so when you need a break, there is no downtime for your resources. When managed well, your income works for you. </p>
